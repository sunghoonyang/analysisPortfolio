<h1>Food World Cup</h1>

Hello world! this is my sample data analysis. Data is from fivethirtyeight.com

Clean up
1. shorten the column names from 
"Please rate how much you like the traditional cuisine of (name).""
							to
"(name)"
and so on. The second and third column names are shortened as following:
#  1RespondentID
#  2degree of culinary skills 
#  3degree of interest
#  4Please rate how much you like the traditional cuisine of Algeria:
#  5Please rate how much you like the traditional cuisine of Argentina.  
#  ...																	    
#  "end of the column; length of the column: 48"
There are 48 columns. So I will output csv with 48 columns with the subsequent data attached to the respective column

with pythonCleaner.csv, the data is cleaned up and is ready for R visualisation!
