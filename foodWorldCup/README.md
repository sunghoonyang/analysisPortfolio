<h1>Food World Cup</h1>

Hello world! this is my sample data analysis. Data is from fivethirtyeight.com

Clean up
1. shorten the column names from 
"Please rate how much you like the traditional cuisine of (name).""
							to
"(name)"
and so on. column names are shortened as following:

RespondentID
degree of culinary skills 
degree of interest
Algeria

...																	    

There are 48 columns. So I will output csv with 48 columns with the subsequent data attached to the respective column
with cleanUp.csv, the data is cleaned up and is ready for R visualisation!
